## About This Project

This project uses machine learning techniques to cluster countries based on various democracy indicators, identifying patterns that go beyond traditional classifications of democratic, hybrid, and authoritarian regimes.

Key findings include:
- Identification of transition countries at cluster boundaries
- Patterns of regional democratic development
- Insights into the relationship between various democracy indicators

## Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- Plotly
- Pandas
- NumPy

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
