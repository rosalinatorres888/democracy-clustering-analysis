# Democracy Index Clustering Analysis

An interactive data visualization of unsupervised machine learning analysis applied to the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how machine learning algorithms can naturally discover political regime patterns that align with expert classifications. The analysis reveals key insights about democratic dimensions and borderline countries.

## Features

- Interactive country explorer with detailed democratic dimensions
- Visual clustering of countries by electoral process and civil liberties
- ML model performance comparison
- Feature importance analysis
- Democracy score trends over time (2017-2024)
- Special focus on borderline regimes between classifications

## Technology Stack

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- D3.js for data visualization
- Chart.js for interactive charts
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Data Sources

All data is based on the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index with additional machine learning analysis performed by Rosalina Torres as part of a data analytics engineering project at Northeastern University.
